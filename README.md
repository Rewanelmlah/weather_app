##Daily_weather is an #weather_app
It presents the daily weather situation when searching for a specific city.
It shows us the average temperature, date, the maximum temperature, the minimum temperature and the weather condition,
##all_of_this_done_by using  ##API.
New technologies such as State management and patterns, for example, Bloc and Cubit, have been used.
I would like to note that the application themes changes according to the weather conditions.
